``nH``; i.e. ``2H``-``6H``, "Resample the time-resolution by averaging over every ``n`` snapshots", ``prepare_network``: `average_every_nhours() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L110>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L146>`_), In active use
``Co2L``, "Add an overall absolute carbon-dioxide emissions limit configured in ``electricity: co2limit``. If a float is appended an overall emission limit relative to the emission level given in ``electricity: co2base`` is added (e.g. ``Co2L0.05`` limits emissisions to 5% of what is given in ``electricity: co2base``)", ``prepare_network``: `add_co2limit() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L19>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L154>`_, In active use
``Ep``, "Add emission price configured in ``costs: emission_prices: co2`` to ``marginal_cost`` of generators (other emission types listed in ``network.carriers`` possible as well). Alternatively, a carbon-dioxide price can be appended to the option as a float (e.g. ``Ep50.0`` would set a price of 50 EUR/t). Takes precedence over setting ``costs: emission_prices``.", ``prepare_network``: `add_emission_prices() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L24>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L158>`_, In active use
``CCL``, "Add minimum and maximum levels of generator nominal capacity per carrier for individual countries. These can be specified in the file linked at ``electricity: agg_p_nom_limits`` in the configuration. File defaults to ``data/agg_p_nom_minmax.csv``.", ``solve_network``, In active use
``SC``, "Add N-1 contingency constraints considering outages of any one AC transmission line. Does not consider outages of HVDC links. If a float is appended, a uniform approximate security margin ``s_max_pu`` is applied to all lines (e.g. ``SC0.8`` allows all lines to be used up to 80% or their nominal capacity). Takes precedence over setting ``lines: s_max_pu``.", ``prepare-network`` and ``solve_network``, In active use
``BAU``, "Add a per-``carrier`` minimal overall capacity; i.e. at least ``40GW`` of ``OCGT`` in Europe; configured in ``electricity: BAU_mincapacities``", ``solve_network``: `add_opts_constraints() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/solve_network.py#L66>`_, Untested
``SAFE``, "Add a capacity reserve margin of a certain fraction above the peak demand to which renewable generators and storage do *not* contribute. Ignores network.", ``solve_network`` `add_opts_constraints() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/solve_network.py#L73>`_, Untested
